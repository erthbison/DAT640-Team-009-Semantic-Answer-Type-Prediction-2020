	abstract = {This paper summarizes our participation in the SMART Task of the ISWC 2020 Challenge. A particular question we are interested in answering is how well neural methods, and speciﬁcally transformer models, such as BERT, perform on the answer type prediction task compared to traditional approaches. Our main ﬁnding is that coarse-grained answer types can be identiﬁed eﬀectively with standard text classiﬁcation methods, with over 95\% accuracy, and BERT can bring only marginal improvements. For ﬁne-grained type detection, on the other hand, BERT clearly outperforms previous retrieval-based approaches.},

	abstract = {Each year the International Semantic Web Conference accepts a set of Semantic Web Challenges to establish competitions that will advance state of the art solutions in any given problem domain. The SeMantic AnsweR Type prediction task (SMART) was part of ISWC 2020 challenges. Question type and answer type prediction can play a key role in knowledge base question answering systems providing insights that are helpful to generate correct queries or rank the answer candidates. More concretely, given a question in natural language, the task of SMART challenge is, to predict the answer type using a target ontology (e.g., DBpedia or Wikidata).},
